As a QA Engineer, I work on projects that require high-quality testing and assurance of software systems and applications. I have more than 9 years of experience in the field, as well as a CTFL certification and an MBA in Software Quality Management.

My core competencies include planning and executing test cases and test plans, using tools such as Azure DevOps and Jira. I also have expertise in test automation, using languages and frameworks such as Python, Selenium, Cypress, and Behave, but I feel comfortable working with other languages, such as Java, Ruby and others. 

I have contributed to the success of projects for clients in various domains, such as e-commerce, banking, and credit solutions. My mission is to ensure the delivery of reliable, secure, and user-friendly software products that meet the expectations and needs of the end-users and stakeholders.
